Chrome if you've got it open.
Right-click on the Chrome shortcut on your desktop.
Go ahead and select “Properties.”
Now, in that Target field, after Chrome.exe", just add a space and paste in--disable-features=UseEcoQoSForBackgroundProcess
Click “Apply,” then “OK.”
If your computer asks for administrator permission, click “Continue.”
Launch Chrome using that shortcut, and if you want to double-check, head to chrome://version to see if the command line flag is there.
